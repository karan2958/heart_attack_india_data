# Heart Attack India Data Analysis üöë

**Hello Readers**  
I sourced this dataset from Kaggle and performed a full exploratory and predictive analysis in **Heart Attack India.ipynb**. In the first section, you‚Äôll see how to load and **clean** the data‚Äîan essential step before any modeling. Next, I generated a variety of visualizations (Bar Chart, Histogram, Heatmap, Scatter Plot, ROC Curve) to uncover patterns. Finally, I built a logistic regression model to predict heart attack risk, evaluating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC‚ÄìAUC.

## üîç About

This project analyzes heart attack risk factors using patient data drawn from a Kaggle dataset. It explores demographic, clinical, and exercise-related variables to understand their influence on heart disease incidence in an Indian context, and then builds a predictive model to classify risk.

## üìÇ Dataset

The analysis uses **heart_attack_prediction_india.csv**, which contains the following features:

- **age**: Patient age in years  
- **sex**: Gender (0 = female, 1 = male)  
- **cp**: Chest pain type (0‚Äì3)  
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure  
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dL  
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (0 = false, 1 = true)  
- **restecg**: Resting ECG results (0‚Äì2)  
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved  
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (0 = no, 1 = yes)  
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest  
- **slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0‚Äì2)  
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0‚Äì3) colored by fluoroscopy  
- **thal**: Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect)  
- **target**: Heart attack (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

1. **Loaded** the CSV into a pandas DataFrame  
2. **Explored** missing values and duplicate records  
3. **Handled** nulls via imputation or removal, as appropriate  
4. **Encoded** categorical variables and standardized formats  
5. **Scaled** numeric features in preparation for modeling

2. **Gender differences:** _[Summarize male vs. female risk rates.]_  
3. **Cholesterol correlation:** _[Highlight how cholesterol levels relate to the target.]_  
4. **Exercise impact:** _[Discuss trends in max heart rate and exercise‚Äêinduced angina.]_  
5. **Predictive performance:** Our logistic regression model achieved **X% accuracy** with an ROC AUC of **Y%**.

## üìä Visualizations

I leveraged these chart types to tell the story:

- **Bar Chart** for categorical distributions (e.g., chest pain types)  
- **Histogram** for continuous features (e.g., age, cholesterol)  
- **Heatmap** of feature correlations  
- **Scatter Plot** showing relationships (e.g., age vs. max heart rate)  
- **ROC Curve** illustrating model discrimination power

## ü§ñ Modeling & Evaluation

- Trained a **Logistic Regression** classifier with Scikit-learn  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC  
- Applied **train-test split** and **cross-validation** for robustness
